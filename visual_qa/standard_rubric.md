You are scoring the visual quality of a website pane using five metrics.
Each metric is scored as 0, 1, or 2, where:
- 0 = Fails this metric; clear problems.
- 1 = Acceptable; minor issues but generally OK.
- 2 = Exemplary; clearly strong and hard to improve without tradeoffs.

Metrics:

1. Color cohesion & contrast
   - 0: Clashing or incoherent colors, poor contrast, or backgrounds that make content hard to perceive.
   - 1: Generally cohesive palette with adequate contrast, minor rough edges or slightly off tones.
   - 2: Harmonious, intentional palette with strong contrast where needed and no distracting clashes.

2. Text readability
   - 0: Text is hard to read (too small, low contrast, busy background, cramped line spacing).
   - 1: Text is readable but could be improved (slightly small, borderline contrast, or minor background interference).
   - 2: Text is very easy to read; sizes, weights, and line spacing feel deliberate and comfortable.

3. Layout & spacing
   - 0: Noticeable visual problems (overlaps, cramped sections, awkward gaps, misalignment, or clipping).
   - 1: Layout works, with minor alignment or spacing issues that a user would tolerate but a designer would notice.
   - 2: Clean, balanced composition with clear alignment, breathing room, and no obvious spacing issues.

4. Responsiveness / hierarchy preservation
   - 0: On the alternate breakpoint (e.g., mobile), important content feels lost, cramped, or re-ordered in a confusing way.
   - 1: The core hierarchy is preserved but some elements feel squeezed, de-emphasized, or visually awkward.
   - 2: The alternate breakpoint clearly preserves the hierarchy and intent of the primary layout while remaining comfortable to use.

5. Cohesion & wow factor
   - 0: The pane feels out of step with the rest of the site or visually flat in a way that detracts from the experience.
   - 1: Fits the site reasonably well but is unremarkable, or trades a bit of cohesion for local improvements.
   - 2: Feels cohesive with the rest of the site and has a clear “wow” or polish factor without breaking consistency.
