<p>I built my first interactive web app and got all geared up to share it here on Substack, only to discover that Substack offers no way to embed it! Madness. Well, I offer a couple sample outputs below, but if you&#8217;d like to play with the interactive version, you can just <a href="https://chriscarrollsmith.shinyapps.io/c19-return-comparer/">click here</a> to view it on the web.</p><h1>Equal-weight strategies have outperformed</h1><p>The interactive web app offers a couple different ways to slice the data: either by equal-weighted returns or market-weighted returns. </p><p>As you can see from the plots below, there&#8217;s not a <em>huge</em> difference between the two, but equal weighting has tended to exaggerate sector performance since the appearance of Covid-19. Underperforming sectors underperformed a bit more in an equal-weighted strategy, and overperforming sectors overperformed a bit more. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:504414,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qYei!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61ee8dd3-2385-44b4-833b-3b553309c068_2880x1620.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Overall, it&#8217;s been a good few years for equal-weighted strategies, mostly because we&#8217;re coming out of a bit of a decade-long large-cap bubble.

One of the big narratives out of the Covid-19 pandemic was that the pandemic accelerated shifts toward telecommuting and work-from-home. So how can it be that the one sector with <em>negative</em> returns from pre-pandemic levels is the Communication Services sector? The traditionally defensive Real Estate and Utilities sectors have also underperformed&#8212;not what you would expect in a pandemic, although the collapse of Real Estate demand makes sense with commercial storefront closures.</p><p>The outperformance of Energy is unexpected, as well. Covid-19 heavily impacted the transportation industry, reducing demand for passenger air and sea travel. You&#8217;d think that this would have killed fuel demand. And indeed, Energy was the hardest-hit sector in the early days of the pandemic, with a dramatic &gt;50% plunge. But the sector came roaring back to also make, by far, the highest highs from pre-pandemic levels. As of today, the sector is up over 100%, no matter how you weight the index. The second-place performance of the Materials sector makes a bit more sense, given how the pandemic shifted demand from services to physical goods.</p><p>To some extent, this counterintuitive sector performance is related to underlying structural issues in the respective sectors that had nothing to do with the pandemic. The Communication Services sector had gotten a little oversaturated after a decade of strong performance, and the Energy sector had gotten pretty underinvested after a decade-long lag. Thus, we ended up oversupplied with Communications Services and undersupplied with Energy. </p><p>And then there&#8217;s the odd way that the pandemic &#8220;pulled forward&#8221; Communications Services demand and deferred Energy demand into the future, which exaggerated the underlying supply dynamics. Communications Services firms overinvested during the pandemic, with massive hiring. Energy firms underinvested and underproduced, shuttering lots of oil wells because prices were down. When the country opened back up with trillions of dollars of stimulus burning holes in people&#8217;s pockets, Communications Services revenue growth went negative, and there just wasn&#8217;t enough Energy to go around.</p><p>I suspect things will start to normalize as we move forward from here. Mind you, Energy and Materials may stay hot for a while, because there&#8217;s a war on, the sectors are still underinvested, and inventories are low. Oil and gas firms have been reluctant to drill new wells, because so many governments are working on phasing out fossil fuels. But central banks are working on killing demand by raising interest rates, and hopefully new technological developments in renewables, energy storage, and grid balancing will help calm things down. Meanwhile, Communications Services firms are tightening their belts and starting to adjust their strategies to make themselves more competitive in the future, so I suspect we&#8217;ll see them return to cash flow growth.</p><h2><strong>Bibliography</strong></h2><p>Dancho M, Vaughan D (2022). tidyquant: Tidy Quantitative Financial Analysis_.
