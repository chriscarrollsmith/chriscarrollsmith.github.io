# README

Created from my [react-booking-website-template](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/react-booking-website-template).

## Customization

Change the 'homepage' and 'name' attributes in `package.json` and the base url in `vite.config.js`.

Edit the data, images, and documents in the public folder to customize the site.

Preview site during development with `npm run dev`.

To deploy somewhere other than Github Pages, change the 'deploy' command in `package.json`.

## Deployment

Deploy site to Github pages with `npm run deploy`.
